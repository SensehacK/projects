<h2>Mumbai</h2>
                        <h3>Mumbai, or 'Aamchi Mumbai', as we Mumbaikars say affectionately, is not only a bustling metropolis, but also a grand example of the intermingling of culture and modernity. The 'Maximum City', as Mumbai is often called, provides every opportunity for both visitors and residents to reinvent themselves, and many see Mumbai as a platform to make it big in their careers and lives.
Mumbai is the most populous city in India. The capital city of the state of Maharashtra, it is widely acknowledged as the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India. Mumbai has something to offer everyone. Home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like BARC, TIFR, and many more, Mumbai is also a platform for performing arts- music, dance, theatre and cinema all reach a wide and willing audience. With the success of the Mumbai Metro and other infrastructural developments, Mumbai is a city on the rise.
For all those who wish to visit Mumbai, we say that there is never a better time than this !</h3>
