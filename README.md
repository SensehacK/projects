# OYCE 2015

Oustanding Young Chemical Engineers (OYCE) is an event that aims to integrate the vast landscape of chemical engineering, with all that is oustanding in young engineers- innovation, enthusiasm and endless opportunities.
It is an initiative by Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers - Mumbai Regional Centre (IIChE-MRC), and has been a part of the chemical engineering scene for the past decade. 
OYCE has always been a very much looked-forward to event for students and young professionals alike. It is a matter of great pleasure and privilege for us to invite you to participate in the deliberations of this unique program which will cover a wide range of topics of interest for the participants.
